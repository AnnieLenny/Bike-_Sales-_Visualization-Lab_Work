# üõ†Ô∏è Power BI Sales Dashboard | Project Overview

In this project, I created an **Interactive Sales Dashboard** in **Power BI** to visualize and analyze sales data from 2017 to 2021. The dashboard showcases key performance indicators (KPIs) and provides a comprehensive analysis of revenue, profit trends, and comparisons across different dimensions, such as age group, product categories, and countries.

## üìä Key Features and Visualizations:
- **Sales Trends Analysis:** Revenue vs. Profit comparison from 2017 to 2021.
- **Revenue Comparison by Age Group:** Interactive pie chart showcasing revenue distribution across different age groups.
- **Product Performance by Country:** A bar chart comparing revenue from different countries.
- **Dynamic Slicers and Filters:** Allow users to interact with the data and filter by date, product, and region.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used:
- **Power Query Editor:** Cleaned, transformed, and imported data from the Excel source (Bike Sales dataset).
- **Data Modeling:** Established relationships between tables and created calculated columns and measures using DAX.
- **Visualizations:** Created line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and stacked column charts to represent the data.
- **Slicers & Filters:** Enabled interactive filtering and drill-down capabilities.

## üìà Steps to Create the Interactive Dashboard:

### 1. **Import Data:**
   - Used **Power Query Editor** to import the Excel data (Bike Sales dataset).
   - Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and transformed it for analysis.

### 2. **Create Data Model:**
   - Defined relationships between tables.
   - Created calculated columns and measures using **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions).

### 3. **Create Visualizations:**
   - **Line Chart (Revenue vs. Profit):** Showed revenue vs. profit trends between 2017 and 2021.
   - **Stacked Column Chart (Product Revenue by Country):** Visualized revenue by country.
   - **Pie Chart (Revenue by Age Group with Proposttion in % ):** Displayed revenue comparisons based on age group.
### 4. **Add Slicers & Filters:**
   - Implemented slicers for **Date**, **Product**, and **Region** to allow dynamic data filtering.
   - Applied filters to focus on specific data subsets (e.g., product categories, regions).

### 5. **Customize and Format:**
   - Used the **Format Pane** to customize the appearance and layout of visualizations.
   - Added **titles**, **tooltips**, and **labels** for clarity.

### 6. **Publish & Share:**
   - Published the report to **Power BI Service** and shared the dashboard with stakeholders for real-time collaboration.

## üìÖ Key Insights from the Dashboard:
- **Revenue vs. Profit Comparison:** Insights into the financial performance and trends across years.
- **Top 5 Cities Revenue Analysis:** Highlights the most lucrative cities for focused marketing efforts.
- **Customer-Level Sales Insights:** Detailed analysis of customer sales and revenue by age group, product categories, and country.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Users can filter and interact with the dashboard to focus on specific periods, regions, or products.

## üí° Key Takeaways:
- **Power BI for Interactive Dashboards:** This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to create interactive, dynamic dashboards that allow users to drill down and filter data.
- **Data Transformation:** Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query Editor** to ensure that it was in a suitable format for analysis.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Analyzed sales trends, revenue vs. profit comparisons, and customer insights to inform business decisions.

üöÄ **Next Steps:**  
I plan to further enhance the dashboard by incorporating forecasting features, adding more advanced visualizations like trend lines, and improving performance with **Power BI Performance Analyzer**.
